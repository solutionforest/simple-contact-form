### Common Issues


**Emails not sending:**
- Check your mail configuration in `.env`
- Verify SMTP credentials
- Check Laravel log files

**Lost style in view:**
- Make sure you're using Tailwind CSS v3 (FilamentPHP 3 only supports Tailwind v3)
- If you've upgraded to Tailwind v4, downgrade to v3 with `npm install tailwindcss@^3.0`
- Make sure your `tailwind.config.js` looks like this:
    ```js
    import preset from './vendor/filament/support/tailwind.config.preset'

    export default {
            presets: [preset],
            content: [
                    './app/Filament/**/*.php',
                    './resources/views/filament/**/*.blade.php',
                    './vendor/filament/**/*.blade.php',
            ],
    }
    ```
